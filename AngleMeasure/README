AngleMeasure plugin for Stellarium
==================================

A simple tool to measure the angular distance between two points.

TODO
====

+ Better selection and clearing - it's a tad confusing at the moment
+ Smarter label position / ability to change label position

BUILDING THE PLUGIN
===================

Please note, these instructions are only directly applicable to Linux.
Windows and OSX targets will probably require modification of the
CMakeLists.txt file.

0.  Install and build the SVN version of Stellarium as per the 
instructions on the Stellarium wiki:

  http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Compilation_on_Linux

NOTE: that the main program build must be set so that the libStelMain.so
file will be generated.  This is achieved by setting the 
GENERATE_STELMAINLIB variable in the main Stellarium CMakeLists.txt file
to 1, like so:

  SET(GENERATE_STELMAINLIB 1)

1.  Set the environment variable STELROOT to the root of the Stellarium
source tree.  The Stellarium build directory is expected to be:

  $STELROOT/builds/unix 

2.  Create a sub-directory builds/unix and change into that directory.

3.  Run:

  cmake ../.. 
  make
  make install

If all goes well, the relevant files should be built and copied to your 
~/.stellarium/modules directory.
