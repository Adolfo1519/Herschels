BUILDING THE PLUGIN
===================

Please note, these instructions are only directly applicable to Linux.
Windows and OSX targets will probably require modification of the
CMakeLists.txt file.

0.  Install and build the SVN version of Stellarium as per the
instructions on the Stellarium wiki:

  http://stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Compilation_on_Linux

1.  Set the environment variable STELROOT to the root of the Stellarium
source tree.  The Stellarium build directory is expected to be:

  $STELROOT/builds/unix   (Linux)
  or
  $STELROOT/builds/macosx (Mac)
  or
  $STELROOT/builds/msys   (Windows)

2.  Create a sub-directory builds/unix, builds/msys or builds/macosx and
change into that directory.

3. UNIX's:
 Run:

  cmake ../..
  make
  make install

If all goes well, the relevant files should be built and copied to your
~/.stellarium/modules directory.

4. Windows:
   Run:
   CD "External modules ROOT directory"/builds/msys
   cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ../..
   make && echo "BUILD WORKED" || echo "BUILD FAILED"
   This will generate the dynamic module ocular.dll and the static binary
   ocular_static.a in the "External modules ROOT directory"/builds/msys/src
   The static module binary ocular_static.a will need to be shortened to
   ocular.a to agree with the Stellarium call.

If all goes well, the relevant files should be built in their respective folders:
   Dynamic module: the ocular.dll must be copied to your $STELROOT\modules\oculars folder
   along with the button icons and Module.ini
   Static module: The Stellarium source will need to be re-compiled with the
   respective USE_STATIC_PLUGIN_OCULAR:BOOL=1
   The button icons and module.ini will need to be copied into your $STELROOT\modules\oculars folder
