This is a plugin to test how we make the GUI work for the Herschels plugin.

The plugin will use the GUI from the Herschels plugin and take in data from the 
database, fed to it from the GUI, and just slew the telescope to the midpoint
of the observed area. 

In other words, the main working function will process these data:

Sweep 10	10h42m0.00s	12h45m0.00s	30d10m00.0s	32d20m00.0s	12-21-1785

and produce on the screen the words Sweep 10: December 21, 1785

and slew to the position: 11h43m30.0s	31d15m0.00s
on December 21 1785
