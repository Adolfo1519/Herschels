# Herschels
A repository for the Herschels project code

I have included a script with some edits of my own to demonstrated how Stellarium can be manipulated. Scripts can be run in 
Stellarium as .ssc files included in the "scripts" folder in your Stellarium directory. 
There are also a couple of plugins which can be added to the Stellarium "plug-ins" folder if you do not already have them. 
They are interactive, so looking at their code will illustrate how we can make GUIs and such in Stellarium.
