# Herschels
This repository is dedicated to working on the Herschels in a Box project. The goal of the project
is to create a Stellarium plugin which can run the various exploratory sweeps the Herschels did 
(starting with Caroline and William, though we might add John). 

The current plugin being worked on is called "PointTo". It is modeled after the Stellarium Oculars 
plugin and the idea is to take in the sweep data from some .ini file and just point to the center 
of the box being traced out by the sweep. 

The functionality is relatively basic, but it exists to learn how to make Stellarium read in data
and perform simple movement functions.
